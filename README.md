## ROADMAP

<!-- * try on backend: https://github.com/sindresorhus/got -->
1. create folders `database`
  * it will be executed on `./index.js`
  * add a Dockerfile that will create a mongodb (map volume locally)
2. add signup, signin and login
  * try to split it into a module so I can plug in wherever I want
3. add functional tests
* try this date library instead of luxon: https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs
* try on frontend (which is to come): https://github.com/sindresorhus/ky
